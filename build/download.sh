# Are you looking at this in your web browser, and would like to install empirica?
#
# Just open up your terminal and type:
#
#   curl https://install.empirica.dev | sh
#

# We wrap this whole script in a function, so that we won't execute
# until the entire script is downloaded.
# That's good because it prevents our output overlapping with curl's.
# It also means that we can't run a partially downloaded script.
# We don't indent because it would be really confusing with the heredocs.

## know what shell the user has. Debian uses 'dash' for 'sh', for
## example.
