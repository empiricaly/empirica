Fix CSS source map corruption error during Vite builds by upgrading UnoCSS

Upgraded UnoCSS from 0.51.4 to 66.1.2 and PostCSS from 8.4.21 to 8.5.3 to resolve the "Unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON at position 24703" error that users were experiencing when running `empirica` after a fresh installation.

This error occurred during Vite's CSS processing and prevented the client from rendering properly. The issue was caused by corrupted source maps generated by the outdated UnoCSS version.

No changes are required to your experiment code - this fix is automatic when you update to the latest version of @empirica/core.
